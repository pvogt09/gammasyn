Instructions for installing toolboxes are found in the section entitled
"Installing Toolboxes" in the computer specific section of the MATLAB
User's Guide.

- Create the subdirectories
 ...matlab\toolbox\solvopt
 ...matlab\toolbox\solvopt\uncprobs
- Copy the contents of the installation disk to your hard disk.
- Add the respective Matlab pathes to the Matlab startup file.

At the third installation step, one has to modify the file MATLABRC.M
found in the Matlab root directory as follows:
Find the section starting with

matlabpath([...

and add the following two lines

'c:\matlab\toolbox\solvopt;'...
'c:\matlab\toolbox\solvopt\uncprobs;'...

The starting substring is to be substituted by the actual path (if it differs).
