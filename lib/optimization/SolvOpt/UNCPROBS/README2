Remarks on the Matlab library of test functions 
for unconstrained minimization made by A.Kuntsevich:

1) The two original files WOOD.M and BAND.M contained errors 
that have been corrected.
 
 In BAND.M:
    Line 40:   J(i,j)=1+2*x(j);
    was changed to   
    Line 40:   J(i,j)=-1-2*x(j);
 In WOOD.M:
    Line 33:             0             0    2*sqrt(90)*x(3)  sqrt(90)    
    was changed to
    Line 33:             0             0   -2*sqrt(90)*x(3)  sqrt(90)    

2) Test functions #30 and #31 have some more local minima that
never have been mentioned by anyone up to now. 
See "http://bedvgm.kfunigraz.ac.at:8001/alex/solvopt/results.html" 
(coming soon) for more information on these minima.
